* Linux: basic commands and utilities
* Linux: access permissions, more commands, basic regular expressions
    - For the Linux segment, the command lines showed in the class, that are available in the slides
    and assignment L02 would be sufficient.
* C:  Core Syntax and Language Organization
    - shows the structure of C codes, and a comparison between C and JAVA codes. Should take a look to understand C better (if you already have experience with Java of course)
* C:  I/O and Function Interfaces
    - covers printf(), scanf(), fprintf(), fscanf(). The example codes in the class and the slides should be enough. C02 was a good practice for this one. 
* Linux/C:  Intro to gcc	
    - how to run C codes using gcc. Should take better look at -W -Wall and other modifiers.
* Linux/C:  Intro to gdb	
    - C03 assignments is going to be very helpful for this. 
* C:  Program Organization and Separate Compilation
    - codes in class and slide should be enough 
* C:  Identifier Attributes
    - slides are enough. you can still look up the codes in examples. Pretty important topic. 
    Make sure you go through storage duration, scope, linkage, global types. 
* C:  Arrays	
    - slides and class examples 
* C:  Intro to Pointers	
    - very important topic and i can't stress enough how important it is lol
